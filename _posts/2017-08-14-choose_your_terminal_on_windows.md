## [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)

Cygwin *is*
- a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.
- DLL (cygwin1.dll) which provides substantial POSIX API functionality.

Cygwin *is not*:
- a way to run native Linux apps on Windows. You must rebuild your application from source if you want it to run on Windows.
- a way to magically make native Windows apps aware of UNIXÂ® functionality like signals, ptys, etc. Again, you need to build your apps from source if you want to take advantage of Cygwin functionality.
