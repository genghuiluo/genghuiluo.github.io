## Retrieving all PK and FK

> You can use the function pg\_get\_constraintdef(constraint\_oid) in a query like the following:
``` sql
SELECT conrelid::regclass AS table_from
      ,conname
      ,pg_get_constraintdef(c.oid)
FROM   pg_constraint c
JOIN   pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.connamespace
WHERE  contype IN ('f', 'p ')
AND    n.nspname = 'public' -- your schema here
ORDER  BY conrelid::regclass::text, contype DESC;
```

## List all sequences

``` sql
SELECT relname FROM pg_class WHERE relkind = 'S' and relname like 'seq_%';
```

## [PG character types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/datatype-character.html)

SQL defines two primary character types: character varying(n) /* varchar(n) */ and character(n) /* char */, where n is a positive integer. 
Both of these types can store strings up to n **characters (not bytes)** in length.

> nvarchar? I'm pretty sure postgres varchar is the same as Oracle/Sybase/MSSQL nvarchar even though it is not explicit in the manual.
