create a database repo: https://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/7.0/0L0/0Y0/040

download a MySQL JDBC driver: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

I just came across the same issue while trying to query a MySQL Database from Pentaho.

Error connecting to database [Local MySQL DB] : org.pentaho.di.core.exception.KettleDatabaseException: Error occured while trying to connect to the database

Exception while loading class org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver
Expanding post by @user979331 the solution is:

Download the Latest MySQL Java Connector / Driver
Unzip the zip file (in my case it was mysql-connector-java-5.1.31.zip)
copy the .jar file (mysql-connector-java-5.1.31-bin.jar) and paste it in your Lib folder:

PC: C:\Program Files\pentaho\design-tools\data-integration\lib

Mac: /Applications/data-integration/lib
Restart Pentaho (Data Integration) and re-test the MySQL Connection.


connect repo: admin/admin
