For the drive space control report, you may have already identified these system resources and functions, but if not, these might simplify the process:

``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    @@SERVERNAME as [server]
    , volume_mount_point as drive
    , cast(total_bytes / 1024.0 / 1024.0 / 1024.0 AS INT) as total_gb
    , cast(available_bytes/ 1024.0 / 1024.0 / 1024.0 AS INT) as free_gb
FROM 
    sys.master_files AS f
    CROSS APPLY sys.dm_os_volume_stats(f.database_id, f.file_id)
ORDER BY
    @@SERVERNAME
    , volume_mount_point
```

| server     | drive | total_gb | free_gb |
|------------|-------|----------|---------|
| HQMRKSQL01 | C:\   | 136      | 76      |
| HQMRKSQL01 | F:\   | 273      | 173     |
| HQMRKSQL01 | G:\   | 1640     | 514     |
| HQMRKSQL01 | H:\   | 1640     | 495     |
| HQMRKSQL01 | J:\   | 499      | 232     |
| HQMRKSQL01 | K:\   | 499      | 303     |

> sys.dm_os_volume_stats missing?

It is available in SQL 2008 R2 with SP1 or later. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh223223(SQL.105).aspx

And this script will combine drive space and database file-level space information at the drive levelï¼š
