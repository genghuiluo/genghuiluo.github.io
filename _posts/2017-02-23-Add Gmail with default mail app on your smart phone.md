```
What if an app stops workingNow that you have 2-Step Verification, you may have trouble accessing your account from some apps, such as:
“Mail” on iPhone, iPad, or Mac;
Chat clients (e.g., Adium).
To get your apps working again, you’ll need something called an application-specific password. Don’t worry—we’ll generate one for you, and you won’t need to remember it.
```

#### 1) access https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords

#### 2) login your google account and generate an app password

#### 3) you will get a 16 digital code

#### 4) use the 16 digital code as password when you configure your mail app on you smart phone
