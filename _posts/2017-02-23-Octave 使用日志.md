The package manager will automatically load the installed package when starting Octave. This overrides any setting within the package.

## linspace & logspace

- logspace, 对数分割
    ```
    Return a row vector with n elements logarithmically spaced from 10^a to 10^b.
    If n is unspecified it defaults to 50.
    If b is equal to pi, the points are between 10^a and pi, not 10^a and 10^pi, 
    in order to be compatible with the corresponding MATLAB function.
    Also for compatibility with MATLAB, return the second argument b if fewer than two values are requested.
    
    e.g.
    logspace(-2, 2, 5)
    ans =

       1.0000e-02   1.0000e-01   1.0000e+00   1.0000e+01   1.0000e+02
    ```
- linspace, 线性分割
    ```
    Return a row vector with n linearly spaced elements between base and limit.
    If the number of elements is greater than one, then the endpoints base and limit are always included in the range. 
    If base is greater than limit, the elements are stored in decreasing order. 
    If the number of points is not specified, a value of 100 is used.
    The linspace function returns a row vector when both base and limit are scalars. 
    If one, or both, inputs are vectors, then linspace transforms them to column vectors 
    and returns a matrix where each row is an independent sequence between base(row_n), limit(row_n).
    For compatibility with MATLAB, return the second argument (limit) if fewer than two values are requested.
    
    e.g.
    linspace(0,5,6)
    ans =

       0   1   2   3   4   5
    ```

## Crash after plot interaction

[GNU Octave - Bugs: bug #48482, Crash after plot interaction](http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?48482)
> Someone said:
> I can confirm that on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) upgrading to the latest stable Mesa as per http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/12/stable-mesa-drivers-ubuntu-ppa (ppa:paulo-miguel-dias/pkppa) the crash is resolved. 

After I add this ppa(mesa drivers), and upgrade ubuntu-desktop(`sudo apt dist-upgrade`), Octave works!!. However, there are 3 new problems:

1. DisplayLink(Dell Docker) doesn't work any more. No HDMI input for my two extend screens.
2. [How to fix “The system is running in low-graphics mode” error?](http://askubuntu.com/questions/141606/how-to-fix-the-system-is-running-in-low-graphics-mode-error)
3. Each time when I login, "system detect errors: xorg..."
